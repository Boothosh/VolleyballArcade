### Volleyball Arcade Game ðŸŽ®ðŸ‘¾
- First finished mini-game
- Written in zig as a first contact point with the language
- Inspired by the game DOS arcade volleyball
  
In the game "A way out" is a scene where you are able to play an interpretation of DOS arcade volleyball on an arcade cabinet. My game is strongly inspired by their design choices.

Player 1 is controlled by:
  - <a> move left
  - <d> move right
  - <w> jump

Player 2 is controlled by:
  - <j> move left
  - <l> move right
  - <i> jump

I found out (through a mistake), that the game is actually funnier if you controll the jump of your opponent (and the other way around) instead of your own :)
You can enable this behavior by pressing the space key before your match starts.
The same way you can show/hide FPS count by pressing f before your match starts.
